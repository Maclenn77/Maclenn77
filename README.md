### Hello, World! :nerd_face:

I'm Juan Paulo, but you can call me just *J.P.*. I'm currently learning Full-Stack Web Development at Microverse ([highly recommended](https://www.microverse.org/?grsf=6h9fw6)). I'm also bootstrapping an EdTech Startup ([check here](https://daiuk.com.mx)). 

**My goal is to develop innovative learning materials for high school students and shorten the achievement gap in Latin America.**

### My Background

I studied Linguistics at National School of Anthropology and History and Sociology at National Autonomous University of Mexico. It could sound that I did a career shift into Web Development, but I didn't. My pregraduate research work was about the language policies in the education system of Mexico. Now I'm learning Web Development because I considerer it as a powerful tool to deliver better policies in the education system.

### My Projects

**Right now, my main project is the company that I founded: Daiuk.*

I showcase my Full-Stack Web Development projects [here](http://juanpaulo.xyz).

I'm also a sporadical contributor of cultural magazines as [Nexos](https://cultura.nexos.com.mx/author/juan-paulo-perez-tejada/); and a regular contributor of tech-related blogs such as [Developerz.software](http://developez.software) and [Latinamerica.tech](http://latinamerica.tech).

I have in the draft a novel and a book of short stories. I would like to have one day a long vacation to finish that books.

### My hobbies

 I love writing, but I have had time to write for pleasure lately. I even won second place in a short stories contest! (if you read in Spanish, I hope you can [enjoy it](http://www.puntodepartida.unam.mx/index.php/1087-no-0203/1918-0203-la-cronica-como-antidoto-las-batallas-en-xoco-juan-paulo-perez-tejada). 

I like to read science fiction, realism, and pop-science books. ðŸ“š

For a long time, my favorite sport was chess. But as I spend a lot of time in a chair, I rarely play chess now. My current hobbies are riding the bicycle and running. However, I am always ready for a chess match!  ðŸ¦¾
